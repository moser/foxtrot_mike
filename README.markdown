============

FM is a rails app that allows gliding clubs or companies running glider sites to manage 
flight data.

Currently it is in alpha state. There is some work to be done on the accounting part, which
is planned to export accounting information in a Lexware compatible format (i.e. CSV). A website containing
further information is planned to be setup soon.

When a first version is officially released, a proper license will be added. It will probably be 
something like (L)GPL.
