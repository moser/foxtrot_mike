# ideas / long run
- locking for editing (optimistic?) (obj.versions.count?)
- means to delete flights safely including revisions (+ export to another db) (command line tool?)
- add concept of a update event (bundles all changes of automatic update thru a client)
  - add possibility to undo all changes
  - show changes of such an event
