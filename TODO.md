# ideas / long run
  - accounting session
    - add manual accountingentries
  - locking for editing (optimistic?) (obj.versions.count?)
  - locking when stuff is booked
  - means to delete flights safely including revisions (+ export to another db) (command line tool?)
  - add concept of a update event (bundles all changes of automatic update thru a client)
    - add possibility to undo all changes
    - show changes of such an event
