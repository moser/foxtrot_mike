- locking for editing (optimistic?) (obj.versions.count?)
- locking when stuff is booked
- define a "booking now" = 1 second after last booking
  - rules can be edited if they were not yet valid @booking now
  - a rule's valid_to date can be edited if it is after booking now
    - for these rules there should be a "end & replace by copy (editable)" feature
  - new rules must have a valid_from date >= booking now
- column disabled on planes, people + before_destroy => false (=> no more graveyard)
- no destroying (people|planes|airfields), just "disable"
- means to delete flights safely including revisions (+ export to another db) (command line tool?)
- metaprogram/inherit cost rules controller
- controller for TowLevel & sync
- extract immutability into module
- views: 
  - Hauptflugbuch (von/nach Heimatflugplatz)
  - Flugleiterdienstbuch
- liabilities:
  - remove bookedat
- what if there is the posibility to create tow costs both time and level based?
  - remove tow level stuff!
- ValidityCheck:
  - configure module of what is now (time.now, booking.now)
- application config:
  - currency
  - units for height (tow lvl)
  - ...
- tow_levels as integer -> altitude, is ceil'd to next higher available lvl
- OR: remove/hide tow lvl stuff...
- add concept of a update event (bundles all changes of automatic update thru a client)
  - add possibility to undo all changes
  - show changes of such an event

PAPER_TRAIL:
  - item_type should be the real class, not the superclass (STI)
    - add column real_type and keep track of the real class there
  
IN PROGRESS:



DONE:
- bordbuch
- liabilities: create default one if none exists (Trainee/PIC 100%) when booking
- refactor and improve FlightCost, LaunchCost. common interface with manual cost
- interface to fibu
  - save accounts (financial ones) on planes, wire_launchers and people
- formtastic?
- substitue auth plugin?
- replace marker css classes by data-* attributes
- wire launch: +operator
- flight: duration == -1 <=> still flying <=> arrival == nil
- license stuff? get information on situation in other countries (segelflug.de?)
  - create "LawPlaneGroup" n-1 "Planes"
  - table LawPlaneGroupPeople:
    - no entry => Trainee
    - entry instructor = false => Normal Pilot
    - entry instructor = true => Instructor
  - controller & sync needed
- time_cost_rule: conditions (duration (<|>) x) && additive costs (+/-)
- STI <=> actsasrevisable TowFlight...
- keep track of controller (flugleiter)
- payments (map person with a percentage to a flight)
- remove Make*Revisable migrations
- substitute acts as revisable by paper_trail
- cost for Flight/TowFlight (tow rules must not be used for normal flights)
