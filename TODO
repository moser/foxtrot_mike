- STI <=> actsasrevisable TowFlight...
- locking for editing (optimistic?)
- locking when stuff is booked
- define a "booking now" = 1 second after last booking
  - rules can be edited if they were not yet valid @booking now
  - a rule's valid_to date can be edited if it is after booking now
    - for these rules there should be a "end & replace by copy (editable)" feature
  - new rules must have a valid_from date >= booking now
- interface to fibu
  - save accounts (financial ones) on planes, wire_launchers and people
- column disabled on planes, people + before_destroy => false (=> no more graveyard)
- no destroying (people|planes|airfields), just "disable"
- means to delete flights safely including revisions (+ export to another db) (command line tool?)
- license stuff? get information on situation in other countries (segelflug.de?)
- manual costs
- payments (map person with a percentage to a flight)
- metaprogram/inherit cost rules controller
- controller for TowLevel & sync
- extract immutability into module
- refactor and improve FlightCost, LaunchCost. common interface with manual cost


DONE:
- time_cost_rule: conditions (duration (<|>) x) && additive costs (+/-)
