- locking for editing (optimistic?) (obj.versions.count?)
- locking when stuff is booked

- means to delete flights safely including revisions (+ export to another db) (command line tool?)
- ValidityCheck:
  - configure module of what is now (time.now, booking.now)
- add concept of a update event (bundles all changes of automatic update thru a client)
  - add possibility to undo all changes
  - show changes of such an event
- accounting session
  + create
  + add flights
  - add manual accounting_entries
  + aggregate all accounting_entries
  - export them as DATEV,...
  
- accounting_entries
  - invalidation on changes to other models which could influence cost and accounting entries
  
- check seeds file
  - better random seeds
  
RUBY 1.9:
 - NotImplementedError in Filtered flightsController#index
   Please switch to Ruby 1.9's standard CSV library.  It's FasterCSV plus support for Ruby 1.9's m17n encoding engine.

PAPER_TRAIL:
  - item_type should be the real class, not the superclass (STI)
    - add column real_type and keep track of the real class there
  - show diffs or something in views
